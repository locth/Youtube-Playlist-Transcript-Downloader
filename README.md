# QUICKSTART
If you are not a developer, you can download the click-and-run version [here (Windows only)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11C3GbLf8l_F6QkSPfyh1_IKU7-q4GNfJ/view?usp=drive_link).

Notes:
* Your computer might warn you this is a dangerous program (because I write it myself and yet have no certificate), you need to choose **Run Anyway** to make the the program start. You can find the source of program in this repo.
* The program runs as a command line, you need to choose the working mode (video/playlist transcript download), then input subject's name, link of video/playlist, and the language of transcript that you want to download.

# REQUIREMENTS
Users must have python3 installed before running the program. After that, use below command to install required packages:
`pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt`

# USAGE
Open terminal and run below command:
`python path/to/YoutubeTranscriptDownloader.py`

Input:
`Subject name`
`Playlist URL`
`Language to download`

Wait for the script doing its jobs! :)
